This is a database application for the Duel Masters TCG, inspired from the original Duel Masters database found on the Wizards of the Coast website back in the mid-2000s. I added features that were missing in the original database, including exhaustive category search options. The database currently includes all 12 sets that were released in the English TCG between 2004 and 2006, as well as exclusive promo cards. Later, I plan on expanding the database to include OCG sets, at least up to DM-35.
