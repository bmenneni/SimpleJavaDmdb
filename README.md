This is a database application for the Duel Masters TCG, inspired from the original Duel Masters database found on the Wizards of the Coast website back in the mid-2000s. I added features that were missing in the original database, including exhaustive category search options. The database currently includes all 12 original TCG sets that were released in English between 2004 and 2006, including the exclusive English promo cards, as well as English versions of sets DM-13 through DM-17. Later, I plan on expanding the database to include cards up to DM-35 at least.
