This is a database application for the Duel Masters TCG, inspired from the original Duel Masters database found on the Wizards of the Coast website back in the mid-2000s. I added features that were missing in the original database, including exhaustive category and keyword search options as well as the option to search through the body text of cards. The database includes 2600+ English versions of cards up to DM-35 as well as 180+ video animations for cards.
